## üìù Making Changes

### Code Style Guidelines

1. **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for all new code
   - Enable strict mode in `tsconfig.json`
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
   - Add type annotations for function parameters and return values

2. **Formatting**:
   - Use 2 spaces for indentation
   - Use semicolons at the end of statements
   - Follow existing code patterns in the repository

3. **Comments**:
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Document function purposes and parameters
   - Keep comments concise and up-to-date

### Backend Modifications

- Keep the Hono server lean and performant
- Test all API endpoints thoroughly
- Update `systemprompt.md` if AI behavior changes
- Document new tools in the Tools System section of README.md
- Ensure CORS and security headers are properly configured

### Frontend Modifications

- Use Astro best practices and component patterns
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
- Test cross-browser compatibility

### System Prompt Changes

If modifying `backend/systemprompt.md`:
- Maintain consistency with the AI's core identity
- Clearly document any behavioral changes
- Update the README if prompt changes affect functionality

### Tools System

When adding new tools:
1. Create the tool file in `backend/tools/` with proper TypeScript types
2. Export the tool as a `Tool` type
3. Document the tool's purpose and parameters
4. Update the README.md "Tools System" section
5. Test tool execution in the chat endpoint

## üß™ Testing

- Test all changes locally before submitting
- Verify backend endpoints work correctly with sample requests
- Test frontend components in different browsers
- Ensure no console errors or warnings

## üì§ Submitting Changes

1. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   git commit -m "fix: resolve issue with X"
   ```

2. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub:
   - Use a clear, descriptive title
